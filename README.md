Stinking Rich
=============

Stinking rich is a clone of the "Monopoly" board game, created to test the
[AshleyCPP](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish/AshleyCPP) framework.

Note that since AshleyCPP was majorly refactored, in line with the Java original, StinkingRich will no longer compile with the latest version and will require some major updates in order to work again. It is however compilable with a much older version.

The graphics are intentionally basic but functional.

How to Play
===========

The game has three players. You can buy properties you land on, and other players who land on the property are charged.

The goal is to be the richest player; there is no "end point" to speak of; play until a clear winner has emerged.

Controls
========

Space: Roll the dice and move.
Mouse: Click on "Yes" or "No" options to buy properties.
