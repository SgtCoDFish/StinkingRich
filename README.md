Stinking Rich
=============

Stinking rich is a clone of the "Monopoly" board game, created to test the
[AshleyCPP](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish/AshleyCPP) framework.

The graphics are intentionally basic but functional. There are no sounds provided yet.

How to Play
===========

The game has three players. You can buy properties you land on, and other players who land on the property are charged.

The goal is to be the richest player; there is no "end point" to speak of; play until a clear winner has emerged.

Controls
========

Space: Roll the dice and move.
Mouse: Click on "Yes" or "No" options to buy properties.
